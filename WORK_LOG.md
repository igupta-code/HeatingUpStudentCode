| Jan 15 | 10-10:30 |  I tried work out some of the solutions we talked about in class and tried to think about when we need to "recount" or start again. I'm thinking it has something to do with storing the smallest number we've seen as we pass through and "recount" from that position. Kind of like a local or absolute minimum. |
